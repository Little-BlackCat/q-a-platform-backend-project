# Project Documentation: Building a Q&A Platform Backend using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB

This document outlines the requirements and optional features for developing the backend of a Q&A platform using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. The platform will provide API endpoints for users to create, view, edit, and delete questions, as well as provide answers to those questions. The project aims to facilitate knowledge sharing and interaction among users.

*This is [API Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14HBnrM5By3tyYPVJi10TJ9QBl5lUK2n40DDmfTsqokA/edit#gid=1184987068)*

## Required Software Requirements

1. **Question Creation**:
   - Users can create questions with a title and description.
   - Questions can be assigned to different categories such as Software, Food, Travel, Science, etc.

2. **View All Questions**:
   - Users can retrieve a list of all questions from the API.

3. **Question Editing**:
   - Users can edit the title and description of their own questions.

4. **Question Deletion**:
   - Users can delete their own questions, and when a question is deleted, associated answers should also be deleted.

## Optional Software Requirements

1. **Question Search**:
   - Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for questions based on titles or categories.

2. **Answer Creation**:
   - Users can provide answers to questions.
   - Answers are limited to a maximum of 300 characters.

3. **View Answers**:
   - Users can retrieve answers associated with each question from the API.

4. **Answer Deletion**:
   - Users can delete their own answers.

5. **Voting on Answers**:
   - Users can upvote (+) or downvote (-) answers.
   - Display the number of upvotes and downvotes for each answer.

6. **Question Visibility**:
   - Users can mark whether they agree or disagree with a question.
   - Display the count of users who agree or disagree with each question.

## Backend Project Structure and Components

1. **API Router**: Use Express.js to create API routers for handling question and answer management, and other functionalities.

2. **Database**: Utilize MongoDB to store user information, questions, and answers.

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/questions`: CRUD operations for managing questions.
   - `/answers`: CRUD operations for managing answers.

4. **Search Functionality**: Implement question search using text indexing in MongoDB or a search engine like Elasticsearch.

5. **Voting System**: Create API endpoints for users to vote on answers and questions.

## Development Steps

1. Set up the project structure and initialize the Express.js application.

2. Develop API endpoints for question creation, editing, deletion, and retrieval.

3. Implement API endpoints for answer creation, deletion, and retrieval.

4. Add search functionality by creating API endpoints for searching questions.

5. Create API endpoints for voting on answers and questions.

6. Test the API thoroughly, including different scenarios for CRUD operations and voting by Postman.

## Conclusion

By following this project plan and implementing the outlined requirements and optional features, you will create a functional backend for the Q&A platform that allows users to interact with the API, post questions, provide answers, and engage in discussions.
